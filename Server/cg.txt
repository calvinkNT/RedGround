== Respect the community
We don't want you to be purposefully hateful or discriminatory towards other community members. Although we believe that free speech is important, we don't want you to attack other members of the community. We trust that you are responsible, and tons of members respect that trust. Treat others how you want to be treated.

== General rules
Here are some common-sense rules that will put you on the right track:

1. This site is not for hate speech. This means you shouldn't direct hate towards people or groups. Not states, public officials, religious leaders, or any other people who would fit a similar description.
2. Do not advertise or post spam. To maintain the experience of the site, do not advertise off-site content, post completely unrelated content, or create multiple posts in a quick succession.
3. Do not post anything illegal. If we want to maintain a safe community, we don't want you to post anything that could potentially be viewed as illegal or explicit. This includes (but is not limited to) terroristic content, CSAM related material, drugs or drug-related content, and instructions for illegal activities.
If you violate our guidelines:
We have the right remove your content without warning, temporarily suspend your account, permanently suspend (terminate) your account, or completely remove it.

By following these simple guidelines, we hope to see you out of trouble. Thank you for being a member of our community!
